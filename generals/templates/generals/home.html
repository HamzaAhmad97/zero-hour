  <p>
    Command and Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour is the expansion pack for the
    computer game Command & Conquer: Generals, released in 2003. Zero Hour added
    several new abilities to each side, and a new mode of play called the
    Generals Challenge, where the player takes on the identity of one of nine
    generals (three representing each faction) and does battle against most of
    the other generals, eventually confronting a powerful "boss" general,
    General Leang. Regular factions seen in the base game are also available and
    are updated.
